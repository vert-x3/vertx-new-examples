= Vert.x STOMP examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating the Vert.x STOMP module.

== Client

This example demonstrate messaging between a client sender, client receiver, and a server.
They can be used in conjunction with each other to send and receive messages.

The Receiver consumes incoming messages from a queue and prints their content.
The Sender example sends a message to that queue every 3 seconds.

Start an https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[ActiveMQ Artemis] server:

[source,shell]
----
docker run -p 61613:61613 -p 8161:8161 apache/activemq-artemis:latest-alpine
----

Then start the Sender and Receiver:

* link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/stomp/client/Receiver.java[Receiver]
* link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/stomp/client/Sender.java[Sender]
